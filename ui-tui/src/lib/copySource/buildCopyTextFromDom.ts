/**
 * Host-side copy-text builder. Plugged into Ink via `setCopyTextFn`.
 *
 * Walks the live DOM at copy time to find every Box tagged with
 * `style.copyRangeId` that intersects the current selection rect, builds
 * SelectionPoints for the anchor + focus of the selection, and calls
 * `toCopyText` against the registry + transcript.
 *
 * Drag-scroll fidelity comes for free: rangeIds remain in the registry
 * after their DOMs unmount, and the anchor SelectionPoint captured at
 * mouse-down stays valid through scroll because rangeIds are stable.
 * The "extends past viewport" cases that captureScrolledRows used to
 * handle are handled by toCopyText seeing the anchor-side range as
 * fully included (start col 0, span includes the range).
