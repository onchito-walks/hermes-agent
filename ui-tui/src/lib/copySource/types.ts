 * NOT to screen cells. This decouples copy/paste fidelity from rendering
 * concerns like soft-wrap, viewport culling, and drag-scroll.
 *
 * A SourceRange represents one contiguous span of original source text that
 * was rendered to a contiguous block of visual rows. Markdown messages emit
 * one range per block (paragraph, heading, fence, list, etc.). Plain
 * messages and tool output emit one range covering the whole message.
 *
 * Each range carries a `mapVisualToSource` table built at render time that
 * lets hitTest translate (visualRow, col) into a position in the outer
 * source string. toCopyText slices outer/inner source by these positions.

 *
 * `mapVisualToSource[v]` = byte offset into `outerSource` where the visual
